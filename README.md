# Description
All of these algorithms are my solutions to LeetCode Problems using Python to solve.

Always keep in mind Big O notation for time and space complexity
* More time but less space - use loops
* More space but less time - use variables to act as temp veriables

# Am currently doing:
* Arrays - Data Structure
* Arrays and Strings - Data Structure
* Linked Lists - Data Structure
* Hashset (Type of Hash Table) - Data Structure
* Binary Math
* Queues and Stacks - Data Structure

# Need to do:
Data structures:
* Binary Trees
* Graphs
* Tries
* Hashmap (Type of Hash Table)

Sorting Algorithms
* Bubble Sort
* Selection Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort
* Heap Sort
* Counting Sort
* Radix Sort

Dynamic Programming concepts:
* Recursion
* etc.....
