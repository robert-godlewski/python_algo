# Description
All of these algorithms are my solutions to [LeetCode Problems](https://leetcode.com/explore/) in Python.

Always keep in mind Big O notation for time and space complexity
* More time but less space - use loops
* More space but less time - use variables to act as temp veriables

# How to run this on computer
1. Copy repo via terminal
2. run this command on mac: % python3 python_alog.py
