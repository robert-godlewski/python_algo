# Description
All of these algorithms are my solutions to LeetCode Problems.

Always keep in mind Big O notation for time and space complexity
* More time but less space - use loops
* More space but less time - use variables to act as temp veriables

# Am currently doing:
* Arrays - Data Structures

# Need to do:
Data structures:
* Linked Lists
* Binary Trees
* Stacks
* Queues
* Graphs
* Tries
* Hash Tables

Sorting Algorithms
* Bubble Sort
* Selection Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort
* Heap Sort
* Counting Sort
* Radix Sort

Dynamic Programming concepts:
* Recursion
* etc.....
