# Description
All of these algorithms are my solutions to LeetCode Problems using Python to solve (excluding the files in heap for now but will need them later).

Always keep in mind Big O notation for time and space complexity
* More time but less space - use loops
* More space but less time - use variables to act as temp veriables

# Am currently doing:
* Arrays - Data Structure
* Arrays and Strings - Data Structure
* Hash Tables (Hashsets and Hashmaps) - Data Structure
* Linked Lists - Data Structure
* Queues and Stacks - Data Structure
* Heaps - Data Structure (only leetcode base for this so far)
* Binary Math

# Need to do:
Data structures:
* Binary Trees
* Graphs
* Tries

Sorting Algorithms
* Bubble Sort
* Selection Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort
* Heap Sort
* Counting Sort
* Radix Sort

Dynamic Programming concepts:
* Recursion
* etc.....
