# Description
All of these algorithms are my solutions to LeetCode Problems using Python to solve.

Always keep in mind Big O notation for time and space complexity
* More time but less space - use loops
* More space but less time - use variables to act as temp veriables

# Am currently doing: (Data Structures)
* Arrays
* Linked Lists

# Need to do:
