# Description
All of these algorithms are my solutions to [LeetCode Problems](https://leetcode.com/explore/) in Python.  Look under the *What's Covered section* for more details.

This is also a CLI program where you can run certain groups of algorithm solutions.  Look under the *How to run this on computer* to install and run on your local computer.

To specifically look at the solutions please go to the .../algo/solutions directory and then choose the solution file that you would like to see.

# How to run this on computer
*Note*: Currently only have this working for mac

## First time installation using pip
1. Fork this repo to your computer via terminal
2. Run this command via terminal: % pip3 install pipenv

## Running app with pipenv
1. Activate environment run in directory terminal: % pipenv shell
2. Run this command via terminal: (repo_directory_name) ... % python python_algo.py
3. Follow instructions of the CLI
4. Deactivate enviornment: (repo_directory_name) ... % exit
