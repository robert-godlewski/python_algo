# Description
All of these algorithms are my solutions to LeetCode Problems using Python to solve.

Always keep in mind Big O notation for time and space complexity
* More time but less space - use loops
* More space but less time - use variables to act as temp veriables

# Am currently doing: (Data Structures)
* Arrays - Data Structure
* Arrays and Strings - Data Structure
* Linked Lists - Data Structure
* Hash Tables (Hashset = No repeated values, Hashmap = key, value pair) - Data Structure
* Binary Math

# Need to do:
Data structures:
* Binary Trees
* Stacks
* Queues
* Graphs
* Tries

Sorting Algorithms
* Bubble Sort
* Selection Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort
* Heap Sort
* Counting Sort
* Radix Sort

Dynamic Programming concepts:
* Recursion
* etc.....
